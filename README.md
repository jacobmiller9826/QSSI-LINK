# 🔗 QSSI Link — Chain-Based Security Framework

**QSSI Link** is a futuristic, minimalist web application that visualizes and documents the **Link Security Framework** — a real estate defense strategy based on sequential, chain-linked systems for detecting and filtering threats before they reach the operational core.

Built as an extension of the **QSSI Spiral**, the Link system represents the next evolution of decentralized, layered security logic.
